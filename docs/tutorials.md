# Usage

Learn how to use various features of the AI workloads.

## Tutorials

The tutorials start with a shared setup: [Tutorial 0](tutorials/tutorial-prereqs.md). It covers the tools, but also has a required cluster setup step that needs to be run.

For practical examples and step-by-step guides on using the SiloGen AI Workloads, check out our tutorials:

- [Tutorial 0](tutorials/tutorial-prereqs.md): Shared setup for tutorials.
- [Deliver Resources and Finetune](tutorials/tutorial-01-deliver-resources-and-finetune.md): Learn how to download models and data to cluster MinIO storage, run finetuning jobs, and deploy inference services.
- [Language extension: Odia-finetuning](tutorials/tutorial-02-language-extension-finetune.md): Learn how to finetune a continued pretraining basemodel to make it an instruction following model, then deploy models and compare.
- [Deliver Resources and Run Megatron-LM Continuous Pretraining](tutorials/tutorial-03-deliver-resources-and-run-megatron-cpt.md): Learn how to download a dataset and base model to cluster MinIO, convert them to Megatron‑LM format, run a multi‑node continuous‑pretraining job, and validate the final checkpoint with an inference workload.
